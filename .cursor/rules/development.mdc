# Development Rules for Fasten

## Environment
- Use Zig 0.11.0+; set up with Homebrew, direct download, or package manager.
- Recommended: VS Code with ziglang extension, or Vim/Neovim with zig.vim.

## Build
- Use `zig build` for standard, debug, release, and safe builds.
- Use build options for features and target platforms.
- Clean with `zig build clean`.

## Testing
- Run all tests with `zig build test`.
- Organize tests: unit, integration, performance, regression.
- Use memory leak detection and verbose output as needed.

## Debugging
- Use debug builds and Zig's logging.
- Use Valgrind, AddressSanitizer, or platform profilers for memory/perf issues.

## CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions for build, test, benchmark, security, docs.
- Simulate CI locally with provided scripts.

## Workflow
- Feature: branch, test, implement, benchmark, document, PR.
- Bugfix: reproduce, fix, verify, regression test, PR.
- Review: self-review, CI, peer review, address feedback, merge.
