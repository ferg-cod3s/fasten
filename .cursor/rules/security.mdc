# Security Rules for Fasten

## Input Validation
- Validate all file paths to prevent traversal.
- Limit input file size and check permissions.
- Validate and sanitize all input before processing.

## Build & Runtime Security
- Use only Zig stdlib; audit any external dependencies.
- Reproducible, signed builds; secure distribution.
- Strict memory management; bounds checking; safe allocations.
- No sensitive info in error messages or logs.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
- Do NOT report via public issues. Email security@fasten-bundler.dev with details.
- Acknowledge within 48h, resolve critical issues within 30 days.

## User Best Practices
- Only process trusted files; verify file integrity.
- Run in sandbox for untrusted input.
- Keep system/tools updated; secure storage and access.

## Hardening
- Build with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe`.
- Use resource limits (ulimit) and minimal permissions for runtime.
