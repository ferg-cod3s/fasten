Product Requirements Document: Fasten (Zig-JS Bundler)
Document Version: 0.1
Date: May 28, 2025
Author: Coding Partner & User
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for Fasten, a new JavaScript bundler. The primary goal is to create a low-level, high-performance, and lightweight alternative to existing JavaScript bundlers (like Webpack). Built entirely in Zig, Fasten aims to provide deep insights into the JavaScript build process, offering an easy-to-configure and lightning-fast experience for bundling modern ES Modules.
2. Goals
 * Core Functionality: Successfully bundle ES Modules (import/export) into a single output JavaScript file.
 * Performance: Achieve significantly faster bundling speeds compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack, leveraging Zig's low-level control.
 * Lightweight: Minimize resource consumption (memory, disk space for the tool itself).
 * Educational Value: Serve as a practical learning experience for understanding JavaScript parsing, AST manipulation, and build optimizations.
 * Simplicity: Provide a straightforward and intuitive configuration interface.
3. Non-Goals
 * Full TypeScript support (type stripping or type checking).
 * Support for CommonJS, AMD, or other non-ES Module formats in the initial phase.
 * Advanced framework-specific optimizations (e.g., React Fast Refresh, Vue SFC compilation).
 * Built-in development server or Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in the initial phase.
 * Advanced asset handling (CSS, images, fonts) beyond basic JS.
 * Support for legacy JavaScript features requiring extensive transpilation (e.g., ES5 target). We will focus on modern ES Module bundling.
4. User Stories (Who, What, Why)
 * As a JavaScript developer, I want to define a single entry point for my application so that all its dependencies are correctly identified and included in the final bundle.
 * As a performance-conscious developer, I want a bundler that processes my JavaScript code extremely fast so that my development and build times are minimized.
 * As someone learning about bundlers, I want to understand the internal mechanisms of JavaScript parsing and optimization so that I can deepen my knowledge of the web ecosystem.
 * As a user, I want a simple command-line interface to invoke the bundler and specify basic options.
5. Functional Requirements
5.1. Input & Configuration
 * Entry Point(s): The bundler must accept at least one JavaScript file as an entry point.
   * Initial Scope: Support a single entry point specified via a command-line argument.
 * Output Path: The bundler must allow specifying the output file path for the bundled JavaScript.
   * Initial Scope: Support a single output file path specified via a command-line argument.
 * Module Resolution:
   * Relative paths (./module.js, ../util/helper.js) must be resolved correctly based on the current file's location.
   * Initial Scope: Only relative path resolution will be supported. No node_modules resolution.
5.2. Core Bundling Process
 * Lexer (Scanner):
   * Must correctly tokenize all standard JavaScript ES Modules syntax (keywords, identifiers, operators, punctuation, string literals, number literals, comments).
   * Must skip whitespace and comments.
   * Must provide line and column information for tokens (for error reporting and source maps later).
 * **Parser (AST Construction):
   * Must take tokens from the lexer and construct a complete Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the JavaScript source code.
   * Must correctly parse ES Module import and export declarations.
   * Must handle basic expressions and statements (e.g., VariableDeclaration, FunctionDeclaration, CallExpression, ExpressionStatement).
   * Initial Scope: Prioritize parsing import and export declarations accurately. Basic parsing for other common constructs to allow the file to be processed.
 * AST Definition:
   * A well-defined set of Zig structs and enums to represent the JavaScript AST nodes.
   * Must support efficient traversal.
 * Dependency Graph Construction:
   * Must traverse the ASTs of parsed files to identify all import dependencies.
   * Must build a graph representing the dependencies between modules.
   * Must detect and report (but not necessarily error out) circular dependencies.
 * Code Generation (AST to String):
   * Must traverse the final (transformed) AST and emit valid JavaScript code.
   * Initial Scope: Emit concatenated JavaScript with minimal modifications for module wrapping.
 * Module Wrapping:
   * Must wrap individual modules or the entire bundle in a way that allows them to execute correctly in a browser environment (e.g., a simple IIFE pattern or a custom module loader stub).
   * Initial Scope: A simple IIFE or similar structure that allows imports to be resolved at runtime within the bundle.
5.3. Transformations (Optimizations)
 * Minification:
   * Whitespace Removal: Remove all unnecessary whitespace.
   * Comment Removal: Remove all single and multi-line comments.
   * Initial Scope: Focus on whitespace and comment removal first. Identifier renaming and other advanced minification will be considered in later phases.
 * Tree-shaking (Dead Code Elimination):
   * Must analyze module imports/exports to identify unused exports.
   * Must remove code branches that are provably unreachable.
   * Initial Scope: Basic tree-shaking for un-imported exports. Advanced control flow analysis and side-effect detection will be phased in.
5.4. Error Handling
 * Lexing Errors: Report invalid characters or malformed tokens with line/column information.
 * Parsing Errors: Report syntax errors with line/column information, providing meaningful messages.
 * File System Errors: Handle cases where input files don't exist or output paths are invalid.
 * Circular Dependencies: Log warnings about circular dependencies without crashing the bundler.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
 * Performance:
   * Target completion time for a medium-sized project (e.g., 100-200 JS files, ~100KB total code) in under 1 second on modern hardware.
   * Low memory footprint.
 * Maintainability:
   * Clean, modular Zig code.
   * Well-documented functions and structures.
 * Extensibility:
   * Designed with future additions in mind (e.g., more complex transformations, source maps).
 * Reliability:
   * Robust handling of various valid and invalid JavaScript inputs.
7. Technical Architecture (High-Level)
Fasten will follow a pipeline architecture:
 * Input Reading: Read source files from the file system.
 * Lexing: Convert source code strings into a stream of tokens.
 * Parsing: Convert token streams into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
 * Dependency Graph Building: Traverse ASTs to identify and map module dependencies.
 * Transformation Passes: Apply various optimizations (minification, tree-shaking) by traversing and modifying the ASTs.
 * Code Generation: Convert the final, transformed ASTs back into concatenated JavaScript strings.
 * Output Writing: Write the final bundle to the specified output file.
8. Future Considerations (Out of Initial Scope)
 * Source Map generation.
 * Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support for development.
 * Incremental builds.
 * Watch mode for continuous recompilation.
 * Support for CommonJS, AMD, UMD.
 * Configuration file (e.g., fasten.json or build.zig integration beyond CLI).
 * Plugin system for custom transformations.
 * Support for other asset types (CSS, images, fonts).
 * Browser compatibility targeting (transpilation to older JS versions).
