# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Fasten with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

Fasten processes JavaScript source code, which requires careful handling to prevent security vulnerabilities:

#### File System Access
- **Path Traversal**: All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **File Size Limits**: Input files are limited to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Permission Checks**: Only files with appropriate read permissions are processed

#### Source Code Processing
- **Memory Safety**: Zig's memory safety features prevent buffer overflows and memory corruption
- **Resource Limits**: Processing is bounded to prevent denial-of-service attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All input is validated before processing

### Build Security

#### Dependencies
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Fasten uses only the Zig standard library to minimize attack surface
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular security audits of any external dependencies
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verification of all build tools and dependencies

#### Build Process
- **Reproducible Builds**: Build process is deterministic and reproducible
- **Signed Releases**: All releases are cryptographically signed
- **Secure Distribution**: Releases are distributed through secure channels

### Runtime Security

#### Memory Management
- **No Memory Leaks**: Strict memory management prevents resource exhaustion
- **Bounds Checking**: All array and buffer accesses are bounds-checked
- **Safe Allocations**: Memory allocations are handled safely with proper error handling

#### Error Handling
- **No Information Disclosure**: Error messages don't expose sensitive system information
- **Graceful Degradation**: Errors are handled gracefully without crashes
- **Logging Security**: Logs don't contain sensitive information

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Fasten, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@fasten-bundler.dev**

Include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: The potential impact and severity of the vulnerability
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Version of Fasten, operating system, and other relevant details
5. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Coordination**: We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
2. **Timeline**: We will agree on a reasonable disclosure timeline
3. **Credit**: We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
4. **Public Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure after the issue is resolved

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage

#### Input Validation
- **Trusted Sources**: Only process JavaScript files from trusted sources
- **File Verification**: Verify the integrity of input files when possible
- **Sandboxing**: Consider running Fasten in a sandboxed environment for untrusted input

#### Environment Security
- **Updated System**: Keep your operating system and tools updated
- **Secure Storage**: Store source code and build artifacts securely
- **Access Control**: Limit access to build environments and source code

### Build Pipeline Security

#### CI/CD Security
- **Secure Runners**: Use secure, isolated build runners
- **Secret Management**: Properly manage and rotate secrets
- **Artifact Verification**: Verify the integrity of build artifacts

#### Dependency Management
- **Lock Files**: Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
- **Update Strategy**: Have a strategy for updating dependencies

## Security Features

### Current Security Features

1. **Memory Safety**: Zig's compile-time memory safety prevents common vulnerabilities
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all input files and parameters
3. **Resource Limits**: Built-in limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
5. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Minimal dependencies and focused functionality

### Planned Security Features

1. **Sandboxing**: Optional sandboxing for processing untrusted input
2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Verification of input file integrity
3. **Security Auditing**: Regular third-party security audits
4. **Fuzzing**: Continuous fuzzing to discover potential vulnerabilities

## Security Hardening

### Compilation Security

```bash
# Build with security hardening
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe

# Enable additional security checks
zig build -Doptimize=Debug -Dsafety=true
```

### Runtime Security

```bash
# Run with resource limits (Linux/macOS)
ulimit -v 1048576  # Limit virtual memory to 1GB
ulimit -t 60       # Limit CPU time to 60 seconds
./zig-out/bin/fasten input.js -o output.js
```

### Environment Security

```bash
# Create isolated environment
mkdir -p /tmp/fasten-sandbox
cd /tmp/fasten-sandbox

# Copy only necessary files
cp /path/to/input.js .

# Run with minimal permissions
chmod 644 input.js
./fasten input.js -o output.js
```

## Vulnerability Response Process

### Internal Process

1. **Triage**: Security team triages the report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Technical investigation and impact assessment
3. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security fix
4. **Review**: Security review of the fix
5. **Release**: Coordinate release and disclosure

### Communication
