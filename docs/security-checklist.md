# Fasten Security Checklist

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 2025 
**Project:** Fasten JavaScript Bundler  

## Overview

This security checklist ensures that Fasten maintains the highest security standards throughout development, deployment, and operation. As a command-line tool that processes JavaScript files, Fasten must protect against various attack vectors including malicious input, supply chain attacks, and system compromise.

## üîê Input Validation & Sanitization

  - Implement CPU usage monitoring and limits

### Error Handling Security
- [ ] **Secure Error Messages**
  - Never expose file system paths in error messages
  - Avoid revealing sensitive system information
  - Use generic error messages for security-sensitive failures
  - Log detailed errors securely for debugging

- [ ] **Error Recovery**
  - Fail securely when encountering invalid input
  - Clean up resources properly on all error paths
  - Prevent error conditions from leaving system in insecure state
  - Use Zig's error handling to prevent undefined behavior

## üõ°Ô∏è System Security

### File System Security
- [ ] **Temporary Files**
  - Use secure temporary file creation (platform-specific APIs)
  - Set restrictive permissions on temporary files (600)
  - Clean up all temporary files on exit
  - Use unique, unpredictable temporary file names

- [ ] **Output Security**
  - Validate output file paths and prevent overwriting system files
  - Set appropriate permissions on output files
  - Use atomic file operations for output writing
  - Implement safe file replacement for existing files

### Process Security  
- [ ] **Privilege Management**
  - Run with minimal required privileges
  - Drop privileges when possible
  - Avoid running as root or administrator
  - Use platform-specific privilege separation when available

- [ ] **System Interaction**
  - Limit system calls to essential operations only
  - Avoid spawning child processes
  - Use secure random number generation when needed
  - Implement signal handling for graceful shutdown

## üîç Vulnerability Management

### Known Vulnerability Classes
- [ ] **Buffer Overflows**
